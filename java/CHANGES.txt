    Added RPCException class for the internal error.

  BUG FIXES
    Fixed some deadlock possibilities around TCPTransport/TCPSocket.

    Fixed the client bug of receiving multiple messages in one connnection.

    UDPClient/UDPServer classes are the subclasses.

  BUG FIXES
    Calling the function with one null argument caused the error.

    Updated msgpack to version 0.3. This avoids the bug around zero-length
    array and the map.
