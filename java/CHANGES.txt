  NEW FEATURES
    Added timer-based client-side timeout. This prevents reqTable not to get
    fat, when the server doesn't respond with a RPC request.

    Added RPCException class for the internal error.

  BUG FIXES
    Fixed some deadlock possibilities around TCPTransport/TCPSocket.

    Fixed the client bug of receiving multiple messages in one connnection.
    It only deserialized the first message.

    Fixed the server bug of receiving multiple messages in one connection.
    It only deserialized the first message.

Release 0.3 - 2010/05/23
  NEW FEATURES
    Added UDP Support. And the API was slightly changed from 0.2.
    Client and Server class became abstract class. TCPClient/TCPServer,
    UDPClient/UDPServer classes are the subclasses.

  BUG FIXES
    Calling the function with one null argument caused the error.

    Updated msgpack to version 0.3. This avoids the bug around zero-length
    array and the map.
